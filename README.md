CareerSetu: One-Stop Personalized Career & Education Advisor
‚ú® Vision
CareerSetu is a one-stop personalized career and education advisor designed to help students make informed decisions about their future. Our mission is to reduce confusion and dropout rates after Class 10 and 12 by providing tailored guidance based on individual interests, academic backgrounds, and career goals.

üöÄ Key Features

AI-Driven Personalized Guidance: A mobile and web platform that uses an interactive quiz to provide personalized career advice. The system will also have a chatbot powered by RASA.




Smart Career Mapping: Generates a clear, visual roadmap for various degree programs and career paths, showing job roles, competitive exams, and growth opportunities.



Nearby Government Colleges Directory: A location-based search to help students find and explore local government colleges and programs offered, along with eligibility and admission details.


Admission & Scholarship Tracker: A smart calendar to remind students about important application deadlines, entrance exams, and scholarship opportunities.


Inclusive Platform: The system is adaptable for all school boards in India (ICSE, CBSE, State Boards).

üíª Technology Stack

1. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for a lightweight, accessible PWA).

2. Backend (Mock for Prototype): The prototype simulates backend functionality using pure JavaScript and browser localStorage. The final product will use Python and Node.js for backend APIs.

3. AI/ML: The prototype uses simple rule-based logic. The final product will use Scikit-learn and TensorFlow Lite for the recommendation engine and quiz analysis.
